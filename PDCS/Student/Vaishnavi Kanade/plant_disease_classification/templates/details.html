            {% if disease == 'Apple___Apple_scab' %}
                Apple scab is a disease of apple trees (Malus spp.) caused by the ascomycete fungus Venturia inaequalis. It results in dark, scabby lesions on leaves, fruit, and sometimes young twigs.
            {% elif disease == 'Apple___Black_rot' %}
                Black rot is a fungal disease of apple trees (Malus spp.) caused by the fungus Botryosphaeria obtusa. It can cause fruit rot, leaf spot, and canker on branches.
            {% elif disease == 'Apple___Cedar_apple_rust' %}
                Cedar apple rust is a fungal disease caused by Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae. It requires both juniper and apple trees to complete its life cycle.
            {% elif disease == 'Apple___healthy' %}
                The apple is healthy and free from common diseases.
            {% elif disease == 'Cherry___healthy' %}
                The cherry is healthy and free from common diseases.
            {% elif disease == 'Cherry___Powdery_mildew' %}
                Powdery mildew on cherry is caused by the fungus Podosphaera clandestina. It appears as white powdery spots on leaves, stems, and buds.
            {% elif disease == 'Corn___Cercospora_leaf_spot Gray_leaf_spot' %}
                Gray leaf spot is caused by the fungus Cercospora zeae-maydis. It produces tan to gray lesions on the leaves, reducing photosynthetic capacity and yield.
            {% elif disease == 'Corn___Common_rust' %}
                Common rust is caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi. It produces reddish-brown pustules on the leaves, which can coalesce and cause leaf death.
            {% elif disease == 'Corn___healthy' %}
                The corn plant is healthy and free from common diseases.
            {% elif disease == 'Corn___Northern_Leaf_Blight' %}
                Northern leaf blight is caused by the fungus Exserohilum turcicum. It produces long, elliptical grayish-green lesions on the leaves.
            {% elif disease == 'Grape___Black_rot' %}
                Black rot of grape is caused by the fungus Guignardia bidwellii. It causes dark, sunken lesions on leaves, shoots, and fruit.
            {% elif disease == 'Grape___Esca_(Black_Measles)' %}
                Esca, also known as Black Measles, is a disease complex caused by several fungi. It leads to dark, striping patterns on leaves and dark, sunken lesions on fruit.
            {% elif disease == 'Grape___healthy' %}
                The grape plant is healthy and free from common diseases.
            {% elif disease == 'Grape___Leaf_blight_(Isariopsis_Leaf_Spot)' %}
                Leaf blight, caused by the fungus Pseudocercospora vitis, results in irregular, brown lesions on leaves.
            {% elif disease == 'Peach___Bacterial_spot' %}
                Bacterial spot, caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. pruni, results in small, water-soaked, angular spots on leaves and fruit.
            {% elif disease == 'Peach___healthy' %}
                The peach tree is healthy and free from common diseases.
            {% elif disease == 'Strawberry___healthy' %}
                The strawberry plant is healthy and free from common diseases.
            {% elif disease == 'Strawberry___Leaf_scorch' %}
                Leaf scorch on strawberry is caused by the fungus Diplocarpon earliana. It appears as irregular, dark purple spots on leaves.
            {% else %}
                No details available for this disease.
