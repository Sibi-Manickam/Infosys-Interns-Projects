            <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
            <p>Library Importation: Essential libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Seaborn for visualization, and Matplotlib for plotting were imported.</p>
            <p>Data Loading: The dataset 'Statewise Consumption.csv' was loaded into the environment. It contains the following attributes:
            <ul>
                <li>States</li>
                <li>Regions</li>
                <li>Latitude</li>
                <li>Longitude</li>
                <li>Dates</li>
                <li>Usage</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Data Cleaning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Missing Values Handling: Any missing values in the dataset were addressed.</li>
                <li>Duplicate Removal: Duplicated entries within the dataset were identified and removed.</li>

            <h2>Feature Engineering</h2>
            <p>Temporal Feature Extraction: The 'Dates' column was processed to derive additional features like year, month, quarter, and day of the week.</p>
            <p>Categorical Encoding: Categorical features were encoded using one-hot encoding for further analysis.</p>

            <img src="static/images/6.png" alt="Seasonal Consumption Patterns" class="small-image">
            <p>Seasonal consumption patterns were investigated to understand how usage varies throughout the year.</p>

            <h2>Model Building and Evaluation</h2>
            <p>Prophet Model Utilization: The Prophet model was employed for electricity usage forecasting, providing insights into future consumption for each state.</p>
            <p>Prophet Model Evaluation: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were calculated to assess the performance of the Prophet model.</p>
            <p>LSTM Model Implementation: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models were developed to forecast usage, offering an alternative approach to forecasting.</p>
            <p>LSTM Model Evaluation: The performance of the LSTM models was evaluated using MAE and RMSE metrics, providing insights into their accuracy and reliability.</p>
