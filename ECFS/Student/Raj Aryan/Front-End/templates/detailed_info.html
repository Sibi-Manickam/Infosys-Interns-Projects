            <h2 class="heading">Model Building</h2>

            <h2>Linear Regression</h2>
            <p>
                Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one 
                or more independent variables. In the context of energy consumption prediction, linear regression can be applied 
                to predict energy usage based on various features such as state, region, day of the week, and quarter.
            </p>
            <h3>Data Preparation</h3>
            <p>
                In the linear regression model, the dataset is divided into features (independent variables) and the target 
                variable (dependent variable). Categorical features like states and regions are one-hot encoded to convert 
                them into a format suitable for regression. The data is then split into training and testing sets to train 
                and evaluate the model's performance.
            </p>
            <h3>Model Training</h3>
            <p>
                The linear regression model is initialized and fitted to the training data. During training, the model learns 
                the coefficients for each feature, which represent the strength and direction of the relationship between 
                the features and the target variable.
            </p>
            <h3>Model Evaluation</h3>
            <p>
                After training, the model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE), 
                mean absolute error (MAE), R-squared (R²), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and explained variance score. 
                These metrics provide insights into how well the model predicts energy consumption.
            </p>
            <h3>Actual vs Predicted Values</h3>
            <p>
                A plot of actual versus predicted energy consumption values visually compares the model's predictions with the 
                actual values from the testing dataset. This plot helps assess the accuracy of the linear regression model and 
                identify any patterns or discrepancies between the predicted and actual values.
            </p>

        <section id="neural-network" class="section-block">
            <h2>Neural Network</h2>
            <p>
                A neural network is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. In the 
                context of energy consumption prediction, neural networks can be used to capture complex relationships between 
                input features and energy usage.
            </p>
            <h3>Data Preparation</h3>
            <p>
                Similar to linear regression, the dataset is prepared by dividing it into features and the target variable. 
                Categorical features are one-hot encoded, and the data is split into training and testing sets. Additionally, 
                the features are standardized to ensure that they have a similar scale.
            </p>
            <h3>Model Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                The neural network model consists of multiple layers of neurons, including input, hidden, and output layers. 
                In the code implementation, a sequential model with dense layers is used. The activation function 'relu' is 
                applied to the hidden layers to introduce non-linearity, while the output layer uses a linear activation 
                function since the target variable is continuous.
            </p>
            <h3>Model Training</h3>
            <p>
                The model is compiled with the 'adam' optimizer and mean squared error loss function. It is then trained on 
                the training data for a specified number of epochs. During training, the model adjusts its weights to minimize 
                the prediction error.
            </p>
            <h3>Model Evaluation</h3>
            <p>
                After training, the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, R², MAPE, and explained 
                variance score. These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and generalization ability of the neural network 
                model.
            </p>
            <h3>Actual vs Predicted Values</h3>
            <p>
                Similar to linear regression, a plot of actual versus predicted energy consumption values is generated to visually 
                compare the model's predictions with the actual values from the testing dataset. This plot helps assess the 
                performance of the neural network model.

            <h2>Random Forest Regressor</h2>
            <p>
                The Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make 
                predictions. It works by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputting the average 
                prediction of the individual trees.
            </p>
            <h3>Data Preparation</h3>

            <h3>Model Training</h3>
            <p>
                The Random Forest Regressor model is initialized with a specified number of decision trees (n_estimators). 
                The model is then trained on the training data, where each decision tree is fitted to a random subset of 
                the training data.
            </p>
            <h3>Model Evaluation</h3>

            <h2>LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)</h2>
            <p>
                LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture capable of learning long-term dependencies. 
                It is well-suited for sequence prediction tasks such as time series forecasting.
            </p>
            <h3>Data Preparation</h3>
            <p>
                In the LSTM section, the dataset is prepared differently compared to other models. The 'States' column 
                is one-hot encoded, and the 'year' column is added as a feature. The dataset is then split into training 
                and testing sets.
            </p>
            <h3>Model Training</h3>
            <p>
                The LSTM model is defined using the Keras Sequential API. It consists of an LSTM layer with 50 units 
                and a Dense output layer. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss 
                function. It is then trained on the training data with 50 epochs and a batch size of 32.
            </p>
            <h3>Model Evaluation</h3>
            <p>
                After training, the LSTM model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as RMSE, MAE, R², 
                MAPE, and explained variance score. These metrics provide insights into the model's accuracy and ability 
                to generalize to unseen data.
            </p>
            <h3>Actual vs Predicted Values</h3>
            <p>
                Finally, a plot of actual versus predicted energy consumption values is generated to visually assess 
                the LSTM model's performance. This plot helps understand how well the model predicts energy consumption 
                over time.
